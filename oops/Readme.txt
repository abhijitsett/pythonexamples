# __init__() is a constructor method which helps to
# set initial values while instatiating a class.

# __init__() will get called with the attributes set in __init__(),
# when a class is instantiated.

# The '__' before and after the method name denotes that
# the method is private. It's called private or magic methods
# since it's called internally and automatically.
